For example, if \"skew.x\" is\n *         ⍺ and \"skew.y\" is β, then the line x = 0 will be rotated by ⍺ (y = -x*cot⍺) and the line y = 0 will be\n *         rotated by β (y = x*tanβ).

Indeed, if \"skew.x\" = -ϴ and \"skew.y\" = ϴ, it will produce an equivalent of \"rotation\" = ϴ.\n *         </p>\n *         <p>\n *         Another quite interesting observation is that \"skew.x\", \"skew.y\", rotation are commutative operations.

For example, if the alpha of a display\n * object is 0.5 and its parent's alpha is 0.5, then it will be rendered with 25% opacity (assuming alpha is not\n * applied on any ancestor further up the chain).\n * </details>\n *\n * <details id=\"visible\">\n * <summary>Renderable vs Visible</summary>\n *\n * The `renderable` and `visible` properties can be used to prevent a display object from being rendered to the\n * screen. However, there is a subtle difference between the two. When using `renderable`, the transforms  of the display\n * object (and its children subtree) will continue to be calculated. When using `visible`, the transforms will not\n * be calculated.\n * ```ts\n * import { BlurFilter, Container, Graphics, Sprite } from 'pixi.js';\n *\n * const container = new Container();\n * const sprite = Sprite.from('https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/693612/IaUrttj.png');\n *\n * sprite.width = 512;\n * sprite.height = 512;\n *\n * // Adds a sprite as a child to this container. As a result, the sprite will be rendered whenever the container\n * // is rendered.\n * container.addChild(sprite);\n *\n * // Blurs whatever is rendered by the container\n * container.filters = [new BlurFilter()];\n *\n * // Only the contents within a circle at the center should be rendered onto the screen.\n * container.mask = new Graphics()\n *     .beginFill(0xffffff)\n *     .drawCircle(sprite.width / 2, sprite.height / 2, Math.min(sprite.width, sprite.height) / 2)\n *     .endFill();\n * ```\n *\n * </details>\n *\n * <details id=\"renderGroup\">\n * <summary>RenderGroup</summary>\n *\n * In PixiJS v8, containers can be set to operate in 'render group mode',\n * transforming them into entities akin to a stage in traditional rendering paradigms.\n * A render group is a root renderable entity, similar to a container,\n * but it's rendered in a separate pass with its own unique set of rendering instructions.\n * This approach enhances rendering efficiency and organization, particularly in complex scenes.\n *\n * You can enable render group mode on any container using container.enableRenderGroup()\n * or by initializing a new container with the render group property set to true (new Container({isRenderGroup: true})).\n *  The method you choose depends on your specific use case and setup requirements.\n *\n * An important aspect of PixiJS’s rendering process is the automatic treatment of rendered scenes as render groups.\n * This conversion streamlines the rendering process, but understanding when and how this happens is crucial\n * to fully leverage its benefits.\n *\n * One of the key advantages of using render groups is the performance efficiency in moving them. Since transformations\n *  are applied at the GPU level, moving a render group, even one with complex and numerous children,\n * doesn't require recalculating the rendering instructions or performing transformations on each child.\n * This makes operations like panning a large game world incredibly efficient.\n *\n * However, it's crucial to note that render groups do not batch together.\n * This means that turning every container into a render group could actually slow things down,\n * as each render group is processed separately. It's best to use render groups judiciously, at a broader level,\n * rather than on a per-child basis.\n * This approach ensures you get the performance benefits without overburdening the rendering process.\n *\n * RenderGroups maintain their own set of rendering instructions,\n * ensuring that changes or updates within a render group don't affect the rendering\n * instructions of its parent or other render groups.\n *  This isolation ensures more stable and predictable rendering behavior.\n *\n * Additionally, renderGroups can be nested, allowing for powerful options in organizing different aspects of your scene.\n * This feature is particularly beneficial for separating complex game graphics from UI elements,\n * enabling intricate and efficient scene management in complex applications.\n *\n * This means that Containers have 3 levels of matrix to be mindful of:\n *\n * 1. localTransform, this is the transform of the container based on its own properties\n * 2. groupTransform, this it the transform of the container relative to the renderGroup it belongs too\n * 3. worldTransform, this is the transform of the container relative to the Scene being rendered\n * </details>\n * @memberof scene\n */\nexport class Container<C extends ContainerChild = ContainerChild> extends EventEmitter<ContainerEvents<C> & AnyEvent>\n{\n    /**\n     * Mixes all enumerable properties and methods from a source object to Container.\n     * @param source - The source of properties and methods to mix in.\n     */\n    public static mixin(source: Dict<any>): void\n    {\n        Object.defineProperties(Container.prototype, Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(source));\n    }\n\n    /** @private */\n    public uid: number = uid('renderable');\n\n    /** @private */\n    public _updateFlags = 0b1111;\n\n    // is this container the root of a renderGroup?\n    // TODO implement this in a few more places\n    /** @private */\n    public isRenderGroupRoot = false;\n    // the render group this container belongs to OR owns\n    /** @private */\n    public renderGroup: RenderGroup = null;\n\n    // set to true if the container has changed.

*\n * To access a sprite sheet from your code you may pass its JSON data file to Pixi's loader:\n *\n * ```js\n * import { Assets } from 'pixi.js';\n *\n * const sheet = await Assets.load('images/spritesheet.json');\n * ```\n *\n * Alternately, you may circumvent the loader by instantiating the Spritesheet directly:\n *\n * ```js\n * import { Spritesheet } from 'pixi.js';\n *\n * const sheet = new Spritesheet(texture, spritesheetData);\n * await sheet.parse();\n * console.log('Spritesheet ready to use!');\n * ```\n *\n * With the `sheet.textures` you can create Sprite objects, and `sheet.animations` can be used to create an AnimatedSprite.\n *\n * Here's an example of a sprite sheet JSON data file:\n * ```json\n * {\n *     \"frames\": {\n *         \"enemy1.png\":\n *         {\n *             \"frame\": {\"x\":103,\"y\":1,\"w\":32,\"h\":32},\n *             \"spriteSourceSize\": {\"x\":0,\"y\":0,\"w\":32,\"h\":32},\n *             \"sourceSize\": {\"w\":32,\"h\":32},\n *             \"anchor\": {\"x\":16,\"y\":16}\n *         },\n *         \"enemy2.png\":\n *         {\n *             \"frame\":

packed using tools like {@link https://codeandweb.com/texturepacker|TexturePacker},\n * {@link https://renderhjs.net/shoebox/|Shoebox} or {@link https://github.com/krzysztof-o/spritesheet.js|Spritesheet.js}.\n * Default anchor points (see {@link Texture#defaultAnchor}), default 9-slice borders\n * (see {@link Texture#defaultBorders}) and grouping of animation sprites are currently only\n * supported by TexturePacker.\n *\n * Alternative ways for loading spritesheet image if you need more control:\n *\n * ```js\n * import { Assets } from 'pixi.js';\n *\n * const sheetTexture = await Assets.load('images/spritesheet.png');\n * Assets.add({\n *     alias: 'atlas',\n *     src: 'images/spritesheet.json'\n *     data: {texture:
